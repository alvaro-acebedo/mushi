# Mushi
Mushi's Undefined Scope and Humble Intent. As its name implies, this project does not have a clear and revolutionary purpose in any of the fields of computing science. Instead of this, it is intended to represent a good foundation covering all the possible aspects required for a proper software development as I understand it. As my understanding changes in this regard, so will Mushi. The term 'mushi' (è™«) also stands for 'bug' in japanese, which seems inappropriate enough to fit into my standard choices.
